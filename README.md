This repository is all about the Geodesic sciences and projects related therein.

## What is Geodesy

What exactly is Geodesy? Well, below this is what Wikipedia defines Geodesy as.

> "Geodesy is the Earth science of accurately measuring and understanding Earth's geometric shape, orientation in space and gravitational field. The field also incorporates studies of how these properties change over time and equivalent measurements for other planets."


## Remote Sensing

One field of study which is strongly linked with geodesy is remote sensing which deals with both passive and active data measurements of light being bounced off the earth. In the case of synthetic aperature radar or LiDAR these measurements can be used to figure out what the vertical datums are on earth as well as some other key features. Of course the relevance and applications of remote sensing extend beyond this one way in which they're linked this is just an example.
